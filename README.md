# Ireland Smart House Search (ISHS)

This is the final project created by me for Atlantic Technological University (ATU).  
Deployed project might be found here: http://ishs.me/ 

## To run locally you need to:

- Geocoding API key ( https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/star t)
- Time Travel API key and ID number. It will work with free subscription, but pay as you go subscription performs way better ( https://traveltime.com/ )
- Connect your physical database in application.yml. You need provide username and password. 
- Insert API keys information in the application.yml Credentials block.
